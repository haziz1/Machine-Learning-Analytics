,movies,"&gt;**Q:** Actor Shaun Weiss, who played the goalie Goldberg in *The Mighty Ducks* trilogy, has a part in the movie. He’s had a very public battle with addiction and he plays a character similar to himself in the movie. Will you talk about working with him?  
&gt;  
&gt;**A:** It’s a beautiful story. I get choked up sometimes talking about it, but an executive at Lionsgate also followed Shaun and loved him very much. And when the executive read the script, he knew Shaun was just coming out of recovery, trying to get back on his feet, trying to start acting again.

,movies,"Hi everyone, I don’t know if I can post this here and if not I’ll delete it, also English is not my first language so sorry in advance for any errors.

I’ve been trying to find a movie I saw some years ago (more than 7 at least) and I can only remember the ending and can’t seem to find it just with that.

Basically it’s war (I believe maybe ww2), it’s winter and I believe the main setting is in USSR. I can’t remember for sure if they spoke in English because my English wasn’t so good at the time and I used subtitles.

The things I can remember from the movie :

1. Bunch of soldiers (ussr) are in a cabin in the frozen forest and they are struggling and waiting reinforcements until a ton of war tanks appear and they get all happy, then onde of them approaches one of the tanks and a guy comes out and I think they were Germans (that’s why I’m pointing at ww2) and this guy that comes out of the tank just makes a sick smile and runs over the guy that came to meet them and they start getting attacked by the tanks. 

2. The ending scene was a young soldier very hurt and nearly dead laying amongst the rubble and a nurse comes to try and help him but he says something along the lines of “you can’t help me I’m gonna die but I’ve never been with a woman before” and the nurse starts to take her top off and the camera starts zooming out and it ends .

I have to ask what the hell went wrong with this movie? 

Originally Eli Roth wanted to write and direct the film and wanted to keep the brutal, graphic tension of the books opening sequence for the entire run time, making the film feel like you never have time to breath and scared from the events happening. He was planning to make the film more in the style of a Romero ""Zombie"" film with the brutal level of gore, carnage and chaos but with more of a big budget. 


Somewhere, I suppose he left the project because he didn't want to stress himself out personally because of the film studio producers who wanted to make drastic changes in the script so he chose to pursue his own original projects. 


Stephen King ultimately helped write the final script for the film with Cusack producing the finished product which in turn in my opinion was an awful, campy, ridiculous film

,movies,"So with it being March 6th, AKA, the day the Big Lebowski hit theaters, I wanted to talk about...well, the Big Lebowski, and why it is one of, if not my favorite movie of all time, and yes, I mean it. This My Favorite Movie of All Time, I Love, Everything about this movie/film, beyond the memes. Everything about this movie just works, in my opinion anyways. From the acting, to the writing and directing, to the music, to the comedy, to the Noir elements, to the pacing, to the tone, to the timeless feel, everything about this movie just works so well, in my opinion, however, I don't want to last too long talking about this masterpiece, because I am writing this at like 10 or 11 pm at night, not too mention, I feel like everyone has pretty much already spelled out why this movie so great. So I will just to the cliff notes version, as well as explain what the film means to me.

&amp;#x200B;

For starters, let's with the pacing, it's wonderful, the pacing is so daman good, it's definitely a fast pace, but it knows when to slow down and let the scenes playout and let the comedy sink in, and also knows when to pick up the pace, the film is almost 2 hours, and yet, it never feels like it is, at all. Also, the music is so well done, there's no true instrumentals or a proper score or anything like that, instead they use pretty much entirely licensed music, but it works, the reason being, because each songs fits with the scene so freaking well, and each one actually serves a purpose to the scene and the setting of the whole movie itself. 

The characters, are also very well done, not only are they acted superbly by there respective actors, but also, they are all memorable as all hell, from the lovable Stone Protagonist, the Dude, to his crazy, Former Vietnam Soldier friend, Walter Sobchak, to the third wheel, Donnie, who even in death, was out of his element, to the over the top pedo, Jesus Quintana, to Dude's Lady Friend, Maude, even minor characters like Larry Sellers, and Bunny, and the Nihilist, and the Stranger, and the Butler played by the Late and Great, Philip Seymour Hoffman, all of them memorable in there own unique ways. So many great quotable lines of dialogue and memorable and funny moments, my personal favorites being the ""Handoff"" scene, the scene where they confront Larry Sellers, with the most hilarious pay-off I have ever seen, to the point I nearly broke a rib and gut laughing so hard, and the GutterBalls scene, even though I still wonder how Dude got ruffed and yet, ends up on the street somewhere, oh well, anything is possible in a movie like this. The film just also has this timeless look and feel too it as well.

&amp;#x200B;

The film even knows how to handle it's dramatic moments, as the confrontation between the Trio and the Nihilist is played up for laughs, but Donnie ends up getting a heart attack at the end of the scuffle and it actually takes it seriously, allowing the drama and sadness of the scene and the stuff preceding it to sink in, even Walter's speech and Donnie flying into the Dude's face is still taken seriously, and it works. But what I think I love most in this movie, is the Story, and the character of the Dude. 

I'll start with the story, the story is a sort of 90's film Noir, it has all the typical tropes archetypes of that genre of film, right done to the film involving a kidnapping (or just a crime in general) that's not truly what it seems, and I think it does it extremely excellently, not only is it simply a great mystery, that actually had me encaged on what was going to happen and how it be solved, but also it subverts a lot of the tropes as well, mainly with the setting, and, The Dude, which leads me to my next favorite thing about this film, the character of the Dude, the Dude is a subversion of the typical Noir protagonist, instead of being a hard boiled detective, the dude is a lazy slacker stoner who just likes to smoke weed and go bowling, and just all around chilling, he only get himself wrapped up into this whole kidnapping plot, after his rug gets pissed on, but also confronts the Big Lebowski over it, in which the Big Lebowski contacts him sometime later about his ""Kidnapped"" wife. 

The Dude is basically a guide for the audience into this wacky and over the top version of Los Angeles, not too mention, he is simply a likeable protagonist, he actually cares about wanting to save the girl, and even when it's revealed that everything was a just a shame, he accepts it and moves on, because at the end of the day, life goes on, and I think that's actually a good message to teach. Not too mention, allows the film to have a nice bittersweet, yet weirdly feel good....well, feeling at the end, it also helps that he is sort of an everyman for Millennials and Gen Z's everywhere.

&amp;#x200B;

I would talk longer, but the point is, The Big Lebowski is my favorite movie of all time, it's story and callbacks to Film Noirs are on point and so well handled, the fact that you can find deeper hidden meanings the themes with the film beyond the surface (something I forgot to mention but mentioning now) also definitely helps, the characters, especially the Dude, are all memorable, the music is catchy and fits the scenes they are in extremely well, the laid back style and feel and the crazy, bonkers, and insane, yet still sophisticated tone, all fit the film ten fold, the comedy is on point, natural, and funny, the writing is clever, the directing feels distinct, as all the other Coen Brothers films, everything about this film is just awesome, and I absolutely love it, and while we may never get another film like this again, (which is also why Jesus Rolls shouldn't exist and I hope they never make Big Lebowski 2, unless they get the guy behind Top Gun Maverick to make it), maybe that's a good thing, as this film will stand on it's own forever and always. However, knowing this film has feel good vibes, I do think more films, especially in this cynical and doom and gloom day and age, and with how much doom and gloom cinema there is, I think we need more films with a laid back, positive, and feel good feeling and style like this one.",t2_119l1r,False,,0,False,Why the Big Lebowski is my Favorite Movie Ever Made/Of All Time.,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Discussion'}]",r/movies,False,6,discussion,0,,,False,t3_11kpzs5,False,dark,0.51,,public,1,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Discussion,False,1,,False,False,spoiler,1678166181.0,,[],{},,,True,,1678165890.0,richtext,6,,,text,self.movies,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So with it being March 6th, AKA, the day the Big Lebowski hit theaters, I wanted to talk about...well, the Big Lebowski, and why it is one of, if not my favorite movie of all time, and yes, I mean it.

&lt;p&gt;The Dude is basically a guide for the audience into this wacky and over the top version of Los Angeles, not too mention, he is simply a likeable protagonist, he actually cares about wanting to save the girl, and even when it&amp;#39;s revealed that everything was a just a shame, he accepts it and moves on, because at the end of the day, life goes on, and I think that&amp;#39;s actually a good message to teach. Not too mention, allows the film to have a nice bittersweet, yet weirdly feel good....well, feeling at the end, it also helps that he is sort of an everyman for Millennials and Gen Z&amp;#39;s everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would talk longer, but the point is, The Big Lebowski is my favorite movie of all time, it&amp;#39;s story and callbacks to Film Noirs are on point and so well handled, the fact that you can find deeper hidden meanings the themes with the film beyond the surface (something I forgot to mention but mentioning now) also definitely helps, the characters, especially the Dude, are all memorable, the music is catchy and fits the scenes they are in extremely well, the laid back style and feel and the crazy, bonkers, and insane, yet still sophisticated tone, all fit the film ten fold, the comedy is on point, natural, and funny, the writing is clever, the directing feels distinct, as all the other Coen Brothers films, everything about this film is just awesome, and I absolutely love it, and while we may never get another film like this again, (which is also why Jesus Rolls shouldn&amp;#39;t exist and I hope they never make Big Lebowski 2, unless they get the guy behind Top Gun Maverick to make it), maybe that&amp;#39;s a good thing, as this film will stand on it&amp;#39;s own forever and always. However, knowing this film has feel good vibes, I do think more films, especially in this cynical and doom and gloom day and age, and with how much doom and gloom cinema there is, I think we need more films with a laid back, positive, and feel good feeling and style like this one.&lt;/p&gt;

,movies,"WARNING: Speed Racer appreciation post!
Has anyone else seen BOTH of these movies or just me? I was showing my wife a couple movies from my childhood, them being Tron: Legacy and Speed Racer in that order, and I really don't remember Tron Legacy being that bad. I remembered Tron Legacy for its awesome visuals and kick-ass soundtrack and a decent plot. Yeah everything was as I remembered but the strength of the plot. I mean so bad haha. And I get that it was never supposed to be a smart movie but there's just so many questions and plot holes and ""why the hell are they acting this way?"" Situations. I pulled up the IMDb score and it's 6.7 which I think is fair because it still is really enjoyable. After I recommended Speed Racer for a watch being I remembered it being awesome for all the same reasons Tron Legacy was. And it was awesome! As good as I remembered and just because we just watched Tron Legacy I just couldn't help but compare the two throughout. Especially since the IMDB score for Speed Racer is 6.0. An even larger gap on Rotten Tomatoes! The Wachowskis actually got robbed on Speed Racer and I'll use Tron: Legacy as a comparison. 

**Setup**
The setup to Tron Legacy greets us with the protagonist (Sam) who is trying to be a Robin Hood type character. First off he's being followed by a police car because he's recklessly driving his motorbike. Then he breaks into his Father's old company and leaks computer software to the public for free. He then jumps off of the building with a parachute while being chased by police and a FREAKING HELICOPTER. Once they catch him they look like they hold him for a few hours and release him? What the hell did they have him in for? Apparently enough to warrant a helicopter and multiple squad cars but not enough to actually... Hold him? Anyways he heads back to his house which is actually just a gutted Mr Lube with couches and a bed where soon after he's greeted by an old friend of his father's in which he informs Sam that he got a page from his dad's old office at the arcade so Sam should go check it out. Which Sam does and discovers the world of Tron. Minus the insane and actually irrelevant opening that's the setup the only legwork for character motivations are the flashback scene with his father and his father's friend showing up with the pager.

Now the Setup for Speed Racer has us following Speed (haha yes that's really his name) while he is preparing for a Race. Intermingling throughout are flashbacks to his brother's rise to fame and eventual death. It shows his close relationship with his brother, and how they would drive together on the track he is about to race on. How his brother left abruptly when Speed was still young causing a rift between the brother and his father. How his brother's actions after leaving were casting a negative lens on Speed's family. By the time Speed is on the track there are constant doubts by the media about whether Speed will live up to his Brother's rise to fame or follow him in infamy. Speed is outracing all of the competition which leaves Speed racing a holographic projection of his Brother's lap record. Speed is weaving back and forth with his Brother's ""ghost"" while cutting to scenes of him and his brother in his past showing his brother leaving in the night and his father telling his brother he never wants to see him again followed by his downfall and eventual death. Speed inches ahead of his brother clearly about to beat his Brother's lap record then, right before the finish line, eases up on the gas and lets his brother's lap record remain. No one explains why he's doing it in the moment, he just does it out of respect of brothers memory. A beautiful moment of show-dont-tell that could've been it's own short story it's. In 20 minutes Speed Racer already tells a more rich and nuanced story than Tron Legacy. And the best part is that was only just the freaking setup. The rest of the film is a rollercoaster of interesting characters and motivations with a climax that still gives me chills. 

**Conclusions**
There's just so much to talk about and this post would be waaaay too long so really... talking about each movies setup is enough because Tron doesn't get much better story wise and Speed Racer never really let's up with it's interesting story beats. There's obviously some very different tones and settings to both movies but look... if you took Tron as a benchmark for a 6.7 Movie, which I would agree with, then any movie that is beautiful in its own style, sounds great, and has similar plot strength and acting chops then why not rank it around the same? Well I think that Speed Racer is not only just as beautiful in its own setting and style, sounds just as great, but is way stronger in its plot and much better acted. There's some serious Wachowski hate because if you compare the strength of their stories then there's no way Speed Racer would get anything less than a 7.0 if Tron Legacy could get away with a 6.7.",t2_f23hy,False,,0,False,Tron: Legacy vs Speed Racer,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Discussion'}]",r/movies,False,6,discussion,0,,,False,t3_11kpfg6,False,dark,0.54,,public,2,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Discussion,False,2,,False,False,self,False,,[],{},,,True,,1678164319.0,richtext,6,,,text,self.movies,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;WARNING: Speed Racer appreciation post!

She is my grandmother and still talks about meeting Bogart and the rest. Note that the young woman could be around and less than 100. Or the kid who almost drowns in the same flick -- maybe he, not quite 80, is still around.

Or even if someone had a story about such uncredited actors -- the actors could have passed away. Right now, afaik, there is no way to even find out the names of these actors.

&amp;#x200B;

I am fascinated by this and there are occasional surprises. If we do not limit it to major films, since there are actors who are today over 100 and appeared as children, there are probably quite a few films as far back as the 1920s (but no further, I think) with a living cast member or two. Kind of amazing -- imagine living in 1923 and there was still someone around who had appeared in a play seen by, say, John Adams or Thomas Jefferson, a baby extra in some antique production. But because of fewer people living to over 100 and far worse record keeping, if there was such a person, I wonder if we know about it.

If we limit it to major films and credited cast members, two movies come to mind: Grapes of Wrath, one of the cast, Darryl Hickman (older brother of Dwayne from Dobie Gillis), is still alive. Kind of amazing for a film more than 80 years old. The other is Treasure of the Sierra Madre which has Robert Blake -- although uncredited, he is a well-known actor with a pivotal role.

Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948) actually had quite a few young people who could still be alive and maybe they are locally famous for having appeared in that film. I can, however, find nothing about this. Blake, almost 90, appeared in a film whose stars would be well over 100 -- Huston would be over 140. Bogart well over 120.

At its core, the movie is about friendship but it's really genre bending. It has everything from action and drama to musical numbers and romance. Tbh it's best to go in blind. I'm yet to meet a person who has not liked this movie and if they exist, they are very few in number. 

A fair word of warning, you might need to suspend your belief for certain parts, especially if you've never been exposed to Indian cinema before. Honestly, even that doesn't feel like a task because the tone the movie sets since the first moment is that of heightened reality and you just find yourself going along with it because it's such good fun. I've seen people describe it as a ""religious experience"" and honestly, i don't question that.

The Informer was a 1935 film directed by John Ford, the plot is about Gypo Nolan, A disgraced republican army man who anonymously informs on his former comrades and spirals into guilt as his treachery becomes known

At one time, many people considered this one of the greatest film they have ever seen, but I feel that this film has now been overlook as John Ford pretty much outdid himself after this film and directed classic after classic.

All in All, I think this film is underrated. Victor MacLaglen gives a wonderful performance and Won The Oscar for Best Actor as Gypo Nolan, who is presented as a modern day Judas, haunted by guilt, conscience and an impending sense of doom, meets an inglorious end at the hands of former comrades-in-arms. This film is also notable for given John Ford his first Oscar.

&lt;p&gt;At one time, many people considered this one of the greatest film they have ever seen, but I feel that this film has now been overlook as John Ford pretty much outdid himself after this film and directed classic after classic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in All, I think this film is underrated. Victor MacLaglen gives a wonderful performance and Won The Oscar for Best Actor as Gypo Nolan, who is presented as a modern day Judas, haunted by guilt, conscience and an impending sense of doom, meets an inglorious end at the hands of former comrades-in-arms. This film is also notable for given John Ford his first Oscar.&lt;/p&gt;

,movies,"Autobiographical means someone involved in the production is telling their own personal story. It doesn't have to be strictly factual, artistic license is allowed, but like Fabelmans, it would be focused on a real person's lived perspective and view of events. Some examples:

- Audie Murphy famously starred as himself in To Hell And Back, about his own war experiences. Must have been a crazy time, reliving it all for the cameras.

- While plenty of artistic license is taken, the relationship between Spike Jonze and Sofia Coppola is explored in both Lost In Translation and Her. In Lost, Sofia is reflected as the free-spirited and lonely Charlotte with a dour and unengaged photographer boyfriend, and in Her, Jonze is reflected as the artistic and sensitive Theodore, with Rooney Mara playing his critical and uninterested ex. Interestingly, both movies involve falling in love Scarlett Johanssen.

- Mickey O'Keefe and Bo Dietl have both played themselves in fictionalized biopics of other people. O'Keefe was Mickey Wards real life boxing trainer, plays himself in The Fighter. Bo Dietl consults Jordan Belfort in Wolf of Wall Street, though I have no idea how much of that part is factual.

- Coppola I guess made a movie called Tetro based on his own family but I haven't seen it. Two Jacks is also a movie based on the Huston filmmaking family and stars two Hustons, but I heard it isn't great. 

- Hilariously, Edgar Wright made Hot Fuzz in his hometown, complete with a cameo in his old job at the real supermarket he worked. No word on if the town had so many murders, but I choose to believe it's all true.

&lt;p&gt;Cameron&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; Wes Anderson, but haven&amp;#39;t seen all his films to personally confirm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Coen brothers are just on the borderline, since Burn After Reading came out in 2008, but are close enough that you can include them if you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably others I&amp;#39;m forgetting. Who else?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Was anyone else aware of this phenomenon? I was shocked once it was pointed out to me. What do we think are the reasons for this? Does modern technology just not make films interesting?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who is the best director that HAS made one? Nolan or Fincher, probably.&lt;/p&gt;
